# Clone of the website hackreactor.com

This clone website is done for study purposes only.
Any feedback would be greatly appretiated.

This is the first website I finish that is not part of the freeCodeCamp curriculum. I know the code is bad, but the experience gave me good ideas on how to approach the building process of websites in the future.

# Technologies used

My objective is to clone the website with pure HTML and CSS when possible. So far I've had to add a few lines of JS to get the dropdown menus functionality.

I found alternatives to that with pure HTML, but they all seem to be semantically incorrect and bad for accessibility.
